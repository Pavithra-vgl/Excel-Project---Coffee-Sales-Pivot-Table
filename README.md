**Overview**

This project involves a comprehensive analysis of coffee sales data using Microsoft Excel, with a focus on advanced functions, data manipulation, and dashboard creation. The goal was to transform raw sales data into insightful, actionable information through a series of systematic steps. This project highlights my proficiency in Excel, showcasing my ability to use various functions, pivot tables, and charts to create a dynamic and visually appealing sales dashboard.

**Project Workflow**

**Data Retrieval and Lookup Functions:**

1. XLOOKUP: Utilized the XLOOKUP function to efficiently retrieve data from different ranges, streamlining the process of finding specific sales figures and customer information within large datasets.
INDEX MATCH: Applied the INDEX MATCH formula as an alternative to VLOOKUP for more flexible and powerful data retrieval, especially when working with complex datasets where the lookup value was not in the first column.
Sales Calculations and Data Manipulation:

2. Multiplication Formula for Sales: Implemented multiplication formulas to calculate total sales by multiplying unit prices with quantities sold, providing a clear view of revenue generation across different products.
Multiple IF Functions: Used nested IF functions to categorize data based on various criteria, such as sales thresholds, enabling deeper insights into performance metrics.
Data Formatting and Organization:

3. Date Formatting: Standardized date formats to ensure consistency across the dataset, facilitating accurate time-based analysis.
Number Formatting: Applied appropriate number formatting to sales figures and other numerical data, enhancing readability and ensuring the data was presentation-ready.
Check for Duplicates: Conducted a thorough check for duplicate entries to maintain data integrity and ensure accurate analysis.
Data Structuring and Summarization:

4. Convert Range to Table: Converted data ranges into structured tables, making it easier to manage and analyze the data, and ensuring dynamic updating of formulas and charts.
Pivot Tables and Pivot Charts: Created pivot tables and charts to summarize sales data, allowing for quick and easy exploration of trends, patterns, and key metrics across various dimensions such as time, product categories, and regions.
Interactive Data Analysis Tools:

5. Insert Timeline: Added a timeline control to pivot tables, enabling users to filter data based on specific time periods and observe trends over time with ease.
Insert Slicers: Introduced slicers to pivot tables for an enhanced interactive experience, allowing users to filter data by specific categories such as product type or region with just a click.
Data Source Management:

6. Updating the Pivot Table Data Source: Ensured that pivot tables were linked to dynamic data ranges, allowing them to automatically update as new data was added, maintaining the accuracy and relevance of the analysis.
Dashboard Creation:

7. Building the Dashboard: Compiled all the insights, pivot charts, and interactive elements into a comprehensive Excel dashboard. The dashboard is designed to be intuitive and user-friendly, providing key stakeholders with a clear and actionable overview of coffee sales performance.
